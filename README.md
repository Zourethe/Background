# Background

This is the creating process of my default background image, the one that i use in the majority of my social medias. To create this image I used the [sketch](https://github.com/Zourethe/Background/blob/master/sketch.png) file as a base, and simply outlines the logo making it more minimalist. This [sketch](https://github.com/Zourethe/Background/blob/master/sketch.png) file has made by me in the past.

The image editor that i used is [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
